Meeting Notes – Prediction Model Discussion
Prediction Model

Objective

The model aims to potentially replace the “ADV” stat currently integrated into signals and algo execution.

Data Availability

Predictions can be generated as soon as previous day’s data is available in KDB.

Follow-up: Aash to confirm timings with DNA team.

Model Quality

Aash & Aaron believe the current model predictions are strong enough to be shared with clients, based on prediction vs. 9am STVP prediction error.

New Inputs / Enhancements

Andrew explored using futures returns as an additional input.

Other suggested inputs: APAC volume/volatility, day-of-week effects, sentiment from overnight news.

Comment: Hasham noted these are rare and unlikely to significantly influence the model.

Handling Special Days

Month-end/half-days/option expiries: already handled.

Rebalances: require extra work to load raw index predictions from MATA GW.

Earnings: currently no available sources.

Follow-up: Aash to review with DNA team on possible sources.

Productionising the Data

Daily Data Generation

Open question: Should data be produced daily as a CSV file, then loaded into the stats table for access via signals?

Follow-up: Review approach with Anjani, Sanjay, and AR team (once back from holiday).

Client Data Delivery Options

Option A: MATA API (requires additional dev work).

Option B: CSV file via SFTP copy job (simpler, requires some firewall changes).

Things to Share / Next Steps

Andrew to share predictions for STOXX600 for 2025.

Andrew to draft a client-friendly note explaining why the new volume prediction model is better than traditional ADV calculations.
