Perfect — here’s a balanced version: factual but with brief commentary on observed trends and patterns, without over-interpreting or adding opinions.

Summary of Results
Image 1 – Child Order Spread Capture Heatmaps
Heatmaps show spread capture by parent price direction (Flat, Momentum, Reversion).
Top row: All child orders; Bottom row: “First Child” orders only (using the first child’s near-touch as reference).
Y-axis: Child order size normalised by AvgTradeSize; X-axis: Time of day.
Across all parent types, spread capture varies through the day, with generally higher capture during morning and early afternoon sessions.
Larger child orders (higher size multiples) show reduced spread capture.
Comparing “All Child” vs “First Child,” early orders often achieve better capture, suggesting initial placements are more favourable than subsequent re-quotes or re-sends.
Differences across Flat, Momentum, and Reversion parents show that Reversion conditions tend to sustain stronger capture, while Momentum cases appear more neutral.

Image 2 – Post-Trade Mark-Outs (Side Adjusted)
Charts show post-fill price reversion for scheduled child orders.
Y-axis: Reversion / Spread % (negative = favourable move after fill).
X-axis: Reversion offsets (100 ms → 5 s).
Panels: Monthly results (Apr – Oct 2025).
Reversions are generally negative across all months, meaning prices tend to move in our favour post-fill.
The magnitude of reversion typically decreases with longer offsets, indicating the effect decays over time.
Trend is consistent month-to-month, showing stability in post-fill behaviour.
Differences between Flat, Momentum, and Reversion parents are visible but modest — Flat and Reversion tend to maintain slightly deeper reversions than Momentum.

Image 3 – Spread and Quote Count Changes by Parent Price Direction
Kernel density plots show distribution of spread and quote count changes within short windows around child orders.
Top row: Spread change (%) in ±5 s and ±2 s windows.
Bottom row: Quote count change (%) in the same windows.
All distributions are centred near zero, indicating limited average microstructure disruption.
Slightly broader tails under Momentum conditions suggest more variation in spread and quote count around those trades, while Reversion and Flat are tighter.

Image 4 – Spread and Quote Count Changes by Order Size (ADV Buckets)
Same density structure as Image 3, segmented by Order ADV % buckets (<0.5, <1, <2.5, <5, ≥10).
Larger orders (higher ADV %) show wider spread and quote count change distributions, indicating stronger short-term footprint.
Smaller orders remain more concentrated around zero, reflecting minimal impact.
The pattern is consistent across ±5 s and ±2 s windows, confirming that impact scales with order size.

Overall Patterns
Spread capture is highest in early day and for smaller child orders.
Post-fill reversions are generally favourable but decay quickly.
Momentum parents show slightly broader microstructure effects, while Reversion parents align with better near-term capture stability.
Order size and timing remain key drivers of short-term footprint and realised capture quality.

Would you like me to format this as a one-page summary slide for internal sharing (with concise bullet layout and chart placeholders)?
